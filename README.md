# Golang Authorization for RS256-Signed Tokens

This sample demonstrates how to protect endpoints in a Go API by verifying an incoming JWT access token signed by Auth0.
The token must be signed with the RS256 algorithm and must be verified against your Auth0 JSON Web Key Set.

Check the [Golang API Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/golang) to understand this sample better.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for your free Auth0 account and create a new API
client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/).

Clone the repo or download it from the Golang API quickstart page in Auth0's documentation.

### Add Your Credentials

Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and you will see variables for `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_API_AUDIENCE`.
Update these values with your credentials and save the file.

```text
AUTH0_DOMAIN=andyluyoung.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_AUDIENCE={API_AUDIENCE}
```

### Install Dependencies and Start Server

```bash
# Download dependencies
go mod vendor

# Start the server
go run main.go
```

The API will be served at `http://localhost:3010`.

### Endpoints

The sample includes these endpoints:

**GET** /api/public
* An unprotected endpoint which returns a message on success. Does not require a valid JWT access token.

**GET** /api/private
* A protected endpoint which returns a message on success. Requires a valid JWT access token.

**GET** /api/private-scoped
* A protected endpoint which returns a message on success. Requires a valid JWT access token with a `scope` of `read:messages`.

### Running the Example With Docker

In order to run the example with docker, you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#add-your-credentials).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
